## Setup

1. Install Foundry by following the instructions from [their repository](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation).
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the variables
3. Install the dependencies by running : `yarn install && forge install`

## Build

The default way to build the code is suboptimal but fast, you can run it via:

```bash
yarn build
```

In order to build a more optimized code ([via IR](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/ir-breaking-changes.html#solidity-ir-based-codegen-changes)), run:

```bash
yarn build:optimized
```

## Running tests

Unit tests should be isolated from any externalities, while E2E usually run in a fork of the blockchain. In this boilerplate you will find example of both.

In order to run both unit and E2E tests, run:

```bash
yarn test
```

In order to just run unit tests, run:

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

In order to run unit tests and run way more fuzzing than usual (5x), run:

```bash
yarn test:unit:deep
```

In order to just run e2e tests, run:

```bash
yarn test:e2e
```

In order to check your current code coverage, run:

```bash
yarn coverage
```

> **âš  WARNING: Forge coverage is having some issues...**  
> As stated in this [github issue](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2165), checking the code coverage with Forge when using abstract contract is not currently working.

## Deploy & verify

### Setup

Configure the `.env` variables.

### Rinkeby

```bash
yarn deploy:rinkeby
```

### Mainnet

```bash
yarn deploy:mainnet
```

The deployments are stored in ./broadcast

See the [Foundry Book for available options](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-create.html).
